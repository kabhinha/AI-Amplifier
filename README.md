## About the Project

The AI Amplifier Reader aims to revolutionize the way researchers and students access and comprehend complex research materials. By developing a tool equipped with natural language processing capabilities, this project enhances accessibility and knowledge retrieval from academic papers.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to create an innovative voice-activated tool capable of:
- Reading research papers aloud.
- Extracting relevant information from these documents.
- Providing accurate answers to user questions.

This tool's flexibility allows users to engage in productive learning during various activities, such as eating, running, or working out, ultimately saving valuable time and enhancing accessibility to knowledge in academic and research settings.

## Methodology

The cornerstone of this tool is a large language model powered by vector embeddings. These embeddings represent data, processes, and decisions as vectors in a high-dimensional space, enabling efficient flowchart construction and analysis. By mapping nodes, connecting arrows, and decision points to vectors, the system captures the relationships and logic between elements. This approach simplifies flowchart creation, modification, and automation. Additionally, the use of vector embeddings allows for dynamic updates, enhancing the adaptability and scalability of the flowchart system across various domains and applications.

## Features

- Voice-activated interface for reading and interacting with research papers.
- Natural language processing capabilities for extracting and summarizing information.
- Dynamic flowchart system powered by vector embeddings for efficient data representation and analysis.
